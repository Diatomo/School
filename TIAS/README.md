ToneMatrix

This is a music composition tool that is made with the intent for bedroom doodlers to create sample compositions in real time. I'm experimenting with interactivity between a user and an application for a creative tool. Which includes crowd sourcing, aesthetics, and utility.

To Run:

    git clone 
    
then unzip the zip folder inside the 'Data' Directory.
and then open up TIAS_MAIN.html with google chrome

Question 1:

For the alignment example in the slides, generate the dynamical programming table (3pt) and report the best global alignment (including best score) (2pt) for the following scoring system:

Match: +2, Mismatch: -1, Gap: -2

--- GAP A  T  G  C  T
GAP  0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10
A   -2  2  1  0 -1 -2
C   -4  1  0 -1  1  0
C   -6  0 -1 -2  0 -1
G   -8 -1 -2  0 -1 -2
C  -10 -2 -3 -4 -2 -3
T  -12 -3 -1 -2 -3 -1

Final Alignment:
A-TGCT
ACCGCT

AT-GCT
ACCGCT

Both Alignments get a: -1 score

Question 2:

In a clinical case, you have a human patient with part of a protein sequence as DRWQYGDSAVGRHRKVSPNCRFINGFYLENSATQSTNSGIQNGQYKVENYLGSRDHFALDRPSETHADYLLRTGQVVDISDTIYPRNPAMYSEEARLKSFQNWPDYAHLTPRELASAGLYYTGIGDQVQCFCYGGKLKNW

Carry out BLAST analysis for this sequence to
1.Identify the gene coding this protein (3pt)
	-E3 Ubiquitin-protein ligase XIAP
2.Determine the mutation in the original DNA sequence (you can infer from the codon) (2pt)
	- 133 protein is mutated into a tyrosine from a cystein

Question 3:
In a clinical case, you have a human patient with a DNA sequence
C A A C C A G C T G C C C C C C T G C C C C T C C C G C A T G C A G C C T A A A A T T C A G A A G C T G G A T A A G C A G A A C C G T G C C A A G A T C A C T G A C T T A
Carry out BLAST analysis for this sequence to
1.Identify the gene(s) it belongs to (3pt)
	-PIK3C2B
2.What can you infer from this sequence? (2pt)
	That is most likely in the middle of a seqence because it doesn't start or stop with 
	a start or stop codon. Or the sequence is off the reading frame.

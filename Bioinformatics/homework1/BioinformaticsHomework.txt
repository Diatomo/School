Problem 1 
	What are the top 5 genes with alrgest absolute t-score?
		G5
		G10
		EXT1
		MMP9
		G17

	Of the 70 Genes how many show statically significant differential expression?
		3 Genes

	Could some sombinations of genese that are not in your list from part (a) actually be better
	for classification? Why? What are the weaknesses of t-tests?
		Yes, some genes could be better for classification than from part a. One reason
		could be the quality of the data, Another reason might be because the expression
		doesn't follow a normal distribution which the t-tests assumes. That's also a
		weakness of the t-test.

Problem 2:
	Suppose a new sample arrives with gene expression values...What is the predicted label?
		-8.1028 * 0.38 + 3.5380 * -0.132 + 0.3239 * 0.101 - 1.9215 = -5.43
			therefore 0
	What is hold-out error in testSet?
		=44.68%
	What is the resubstitution error?
		=43.33%
	What do these results tell you?
		Well for one I didn't train the LDA classifier on the test set, but took the LDA
		classifier from the homework. Therefore, it tells me how much I correctly classified.
		If I trained the LDA classifier on the training set I should expect a much higher value
		then on my test set. However; because I'm running the error on an untrained classifier
		they both classifier the same. If more training samples were available it might change the 
		results, but probably not by much.

=========================
Give Examples of Each DataBase in separate Documents.

	Where-provenance:
		The description of the origins of a peice of data
		generated, and the process by which it arrives in the database

	Why-provenance:
		Why was the data generaed, what type of context
		or hypothesis was being explored in the generation of the data

	Workflow provenance:
		Worflows that are convention to handle the enormous amounts of
		data being generated
			-Entity = basic data

	Data provenance:
		Where && why was the data created

	Relational database:
		A database structued to recogniae relations among stored itemd
		of information

	Unigene:
		NCBI database of the transcriptome and thus, despite the name, not primarily a database

Biology
==================

	Transcription:
		Transcription is the first step of gene expression, in which a particular segment of DNA
		is copied into RNA. This occurs in the nucleus
			1)RNA polymerase, together with one or more general transcription factors, binds to promoter DNA.
			2)RNA polymerase creates a transcription bubble, which separates the two strands of the DNA helix. 
				This is done by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary DNA nucleotides.
			3)RNA polymerase adds RNA nucleotides (which are complementary to the nucleotides of one DNA strand).
			4)RNA sugar-phosphate backbone forms with assistance from RNA polymerase to form an RNA strand.
			5)Hydrogen bonds of the RNAâ€“DNA helix break, freeing the newly synthesized RNA strand.
			6)If the cell has a nucleus, the RNA may be further processed. This may include polyadenylation, 
				capping, and splicing.
			7)The RNA may remain in the nucleus or exit to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex.
	Translation:
		Translation is the second step of gene expression, in which a particular transcript is translated
		into protein. This is done in the ribosomes in a cell's cytoplasm.
			1)Initiation: The ribosome assembles around the target mRNA. 
				The first tRNA is attached at the start codon.
			2)Elongation: The tRNA transfers an amino acid to the tRNA corresponding to the next codon. 
				The ribosome then moves (translocates) to the next mRNA codon to continue the process, 
				creating an amino acid chain.
			3)Termination: When a stop codon is reached, the ribosome releases the polypeptide.

	Central Dogma:
		Describes the two-step process, transcription and translation, by which the information in genes
		flows into proteins: DNA -> RNA -> Protein. Transcription is the synthesis of RNA copy of a segment of DNA
		While translation takes that mRNA code and turns into a functional protein.

	Promoter:
		A region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Typically, promoters
		are located near the transcription startsite, upstream of the 5' region (sense strand)
		
	Enhancer:
		A short region of DNA that can be bound by proteins(activatoes) to increase the likelihood
		that transcription of a particular gene will occur. These proteins are typically referred as
		transcription factors

	Transcription Start Site:
		The location where transcription starts at the 5'-end of a gene sequence.
	(TSS):
		Toxic Shock Syndrome, a portentially fatal illness caused by bacterial toxin

	CpG island:
		CpG islands are regions of DNA that can be methlyated which can change the expression
		of a gene.

	Methylation:
		A process by which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule. Methylation can change
		the activity of a DNA segment without changing the sequence. When located in a gene promoter,
		DNA methylation typically acts to repress gene transcription.
	miRNA:
		microRNA is a small non-coding RNA molecule (contianing about 22 nucleotides). The miRNA
		functions by silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression
	ncRNA:
		non-coding RNA is an RNA molcule that is not translated into a protein.
		These RNA's are not translated into proteins but rather have other functionality
		including tRNAs and rRNAs, but there are many others with other functionalities.

	Histone code:
		A hypothesis that the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA is in part 
		regulated by the chemical modifications to histone proteins, such is the acetyl or methyl
		tails of histones. Histones associate with DNA to form nucleosomes, which themselves
		bundle to form chromatin fibers, which in turn make up the chromosomes.

Alignment
==================
EXTRA TERMS!!!
	-Othologs = genes in separate species derived from the same ancestral genes in the last common
		    ancestral genes in the last common ancestor of those two species
	-Paralogs = Genes resulted from a gene duplication event within a single genome and are likely to have diverged
		    in their function
	-Homologs = Encompasses both paralogs and othologs.

	Global vs. Local Alignment
		In local alignment you try to match your query with a substring of your subject. Whereas in
		global alignment you perform an end to end alignment. You may end up with more gaps in your
		global alignment whereas in local you may have less, but they'll still be there.

BLAST:
	Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, is an algorithm for comparing primary biological sequence information
	This algorithm enables a researcher to compare a query sequence with a library or database of sequences
	The BLAST algorithm uses a heuristic method by finding similar sequences by locating short matches. This
	method is called seeding. Basically it finds sets of short words. SO the protein sequence GLKFA contains
	a word size of 3 for 3 separate words. GLK, LKF KFA. After it finds all these words they are then assembled
	and scored using a scoring matrix. One such scoring matrix is BLOSUM62.

Microarrays
=======================

How MicroArrays Work:
		When we extract mRNA from a sample of cells, we do not measure this
	mRNA directly. Rather, we make copies, and incorporate molecules of
	fluorescent dye into the copies. 

		We can measure fluorescence! Thus, after selecting the desired probes for all genes of interest, these are
	printed on a solid substrate. Samples containing the target genes are
	processed, labeled with a fluorescent dye, hybridized to the array, and
	scanned, producing an image file.

Significance analysis of
microarrays (SAM)
	Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) is a statistical technique, 
	established in 2001 by Virginia Tusher, Robert Tibshirani and Gilbert Chu, 
	for determining whether changes in gene expression are statistically significant. 
	With the advent of DNA microarrays, it is now possible to measure the expression of 
	thousands of genes in a single hybridization experiment. The data generated is considerable, 
	and a method for sorting out what is significant and what isn't is essential. SAM is distributed by Stanford University in an R-package.

	SAM identifies statistically significant genes by carrying out gene specific t-tests and computes a statistic dj for each gene j, 
	which measures the strength of the relationship between gene expression and a response variable.[1][2][3] This analysis uses non-parametric statistics, 
	since the data may not follow a normal distribution. The response variable describes and groups the data based on experimental conditions. 
	In this method, repeated permutations of the data are used to determine if the expression of any gene is significant related to the response. 
	The use of permutation-based analysis accounts for correlations in genes and avoids parametric assumptions about the distribution of individual genes. 
	This is an advantage over other techniques (e.g., ANOVA and Bonferroni), which assume equal variance and/or independence of gene

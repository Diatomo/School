In order to measure mRNA from a smaple of cells, we do not measure this mRNA directly. Rather
we make copies and add flourescence to them. We then measure the flourescence.

Kinds of microarrays
  -I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clones
    -spotted on oligonucleotie arrays
    -arrays of beads coated with oligonucleotides (Illumina)

  -Agilents

Just because a sample is brighter means there is more mRNA, rather it is also a measure of affinity
to the binding, therefore the measurement is relative.

Affimetrix
  took the chip as a whole and divided it up into 16 mini chips.

Normalization!

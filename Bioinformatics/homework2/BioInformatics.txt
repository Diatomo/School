	11) Use the UCSC genome browser – and for your genes, are there known transcription factors
	that bind the promoter region (based on the location of the CpG islands). Please provide
	a screen shot. Do this by activating the CpG island feature under “regulation” and the Encode TF Binding feature.

	How many exons does your gene have maximally? (Coding exons are represented by blocks connected by horizontal lines representing introns).

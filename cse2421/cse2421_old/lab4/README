Concerns: I'm a little concerned about how I am indexing through my array
	  because I just made a contiguous 1-D array and sliced through
	  it as if it were 3D. This is good for memory on the heap
	  but if the indices are not correct then it doesn't slice
	  through the array correctly.
I have neither given nor received assistance on this assignment

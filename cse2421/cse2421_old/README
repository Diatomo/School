Problems:
	1) Was terminating the scanf("%d",&ch) for some reason the '\n' char did terminate
	   unless I explicitiy said to do so.
	2) Next I was having trouble understanding double pointers and passing them between
	   functions. I didn't know also what assigning a pointer to a resolved double pointer
 	   meant.
Concerns : I wish I understood pointers better.

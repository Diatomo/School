DESCRIPTION :
	I think the hardest part about this was making sure the logic matched the specifications
	I also had trouble with the way I was indexing my array. It was confusing with height and width
	because the height ended up being the identifier for horizontal movement while rows were for
	vertical movement. I ended up trashing the idea of Height and Width and just went with rows
	and columns

I have neither given nor received assistance on this assignment"

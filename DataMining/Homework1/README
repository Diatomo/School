In order to run the code:

Make these files are in the same directory as iris.py and income.py:
	income_tr.csv
	Iris.csv

There is one dependency:
	Because I used python I used pandas to read and analyze dataframes
		'sudo apt-get install python-pandas'

to run:
	python income.py
	python iris.py

All the inputs are built into the file. I do have loops for multiple k values
but don't have it as an input.

***
NOTE
***

The files take some time to run(2-7minutes), especially the income data set. I've a counter that counts up the number of records to show progress.

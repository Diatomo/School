# DataMining --Homework1

This was about experimenting with proximity measures between two different data sets. It was an introduction
in unsupervised learning methods that eventually led to k-means nearest neighbor algorithm.

# Dependencies:
Make these files are in the same directory as iris.py and income.py

	income_tr.csv
	Iris.csv
	python-pandas
  
# To Run:
	python income.py
	python iris.py

All the inputs are built into the file. I do have loops for multiple k values
but don't have it as an input.

# ***
# NOTE
# ***

The files take some time to run(2-7minutes), especially the income data set. I've a counter that counts up the number of records to show progress.

When k is low the average classification rate is low, however;
when k grows the average classification rate increases, when k = 50
it is about 33% correct on its classifications. The deviations
however; increase dramatically as k increases. From a standard 
deviation of 17% to 54% when k goes from 20 to 50. Therefore;
The number of centroids for a kmeans clustering algorithm helps
with classification accuracy however; only up to a certain point
as the standard deviation grows as the average classification rate
becomes on average better.

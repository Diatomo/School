# Tessellated-Information-Auditory-System

This is a web-based step sequencer composition tool. It was created for a creative study in the art-tech department at The Ohio State University. The idea was to do a tech project to be shown in the art-tech show at the end of the semester. I decided to take my knowledge of programming at the time and write in a language that was foreign to me. 

# To Run:
  1) clone repository
  2) unzip the sound files in the Data directory
  3) open up TIAS_MAIN.html with google-chrome
  
# To Use:
The tiles of each matrix turn on and off. They are audio files cut up from synthesizers in a chromatic scale.
The upper right button saves the current state of all the tiles on in the matrix. A circle will appear below the matrix with a number. Right clicking this will cause the number to go up and it'll play that state that many times before going to the next saved state if there is one. 

# Problems:
The functionality for this project isn't complete as I ended up moving onto other projects after the semester. I wanted to take this idea and start experimenting with electronics.

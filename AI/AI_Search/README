To compile do

	'python UCsearch.py "ABCDP ""
	'python AStarSearch.py "ABCDP ""

		...or any variation on the arguments
It'll display a solution space
then the path to the solution

It shows the parent string
	ABCDP | 
It Shows the action string 
	CD | ABP | ABP

		The action string is in the center and is concatenated
		in the direction that it is headed.

Then it shows the cost and the depth

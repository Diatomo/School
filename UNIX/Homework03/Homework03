Description : Homework 03


Question 1
The different UNIX shells and thus scripts written with them have different syntax for
flow control and variables. Identify for the TCshell and Bash shells the syntax for the
following structures:

  if / else statement
    TCshell
      if ( expression ) then
        block of statements
      endif

    bash
      if command
      then
        block of statements
      fi

      if [[ expression ]]
      then
        block of statements
      fi

    if (( numeric expression ))
      then
        block of statements
    fi

  for loop
    TCshell
      foreach variable ( world list )
        block of statements
      end

    bash
      for variable in 1 2 3 4 5 .. N
      do
        commands
      done

  while loop
    TCshell
      while ( expression )
        block of statements
      end

    bash
      while [condition ]
      do
        commands
      done

Question 2
How can you run a process in the background?
  when you run a command; append & ot the command line
How can you check if it is running?
  ps
How can you stop it?
  kill PID
    PID = process ID

Question 3
Study the following script? What does the script do?
  The following script generates a random number and then in the while loop the user
  guesses the number. If they guess wrong it'll prompt if the guess was too small or too
  large. If they guess correct then they are told 'correct' and how many guesses it took.

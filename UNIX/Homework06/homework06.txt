1. Some commands are useful for running scripts and programs. 
   What are the following pair of commands useful for?
		a. at and cron
			conr = enables unix users to 
			       execute commands or scripts 
                               automatically at a specified 
			       time/date.
					e.g. going to the web to download email.
			at = process management to execute 
			     commands at a later time
		b. bg and fg
			bg = process management that runs jobs 
			     in the background.
			fg = processmanagement that runs jobs 
			     in the foreground.
		c. jobs and nice
			jobs = process management command that 
			       displays jobs in the current session.
			nice = involves a utility for shell script 
				giving its execution a particular priority. 
				20=highest, 0 = lowest. etc...
		d. watch and dmesg
			watch = runs specified command repeatedly 
				and displays the results on standard 
				output so you watch it change over-time.
			dmesg = shows details about hardware drivers 
				connected to, disconnected from a 
				machine.

2. What would be the output after the following awk script is executed:
		ls â€“al > dirfile.txt
		awk -f awk.commands dirfile.txt
	The content of the awk.commands script is:
		#!/usr/bin/awk -f
		BEGIN {sum=0}
		{sum=sum+$5}
		END {print sum}

	This command would sum up the 5th element of the ls -al command, which
	are the file sizes. One note though, the size of dirfile.txt isn't added
	because it runs the command before the file is created.

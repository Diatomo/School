    A container is something in which code is packaged in a standardized way so that they can quickly be plugged
    in and run on the Linux operting system. The importance of containers is like that of shipping containers.
    It's standardized so instead of shipping your goods in a way that works specific to the goods you're shipping.
    It is standardized so the storing and transport process is seamless.

    A Docker is a container technology that compacts the resources together. It can store more resources
    in a smaller space. Docker Containers virtualize the OS, splitting it up into virtualized compartments 
    to run container applications.
